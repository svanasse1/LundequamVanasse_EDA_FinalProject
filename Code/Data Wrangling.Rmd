## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r census}
# American Community Survey (ACS) has data on income, decennial does not
# ACS has yearly data, decennial is every 10 years

allCensusVariables = load_variables(year, "acs5", cache=TRUE)
View(allCensusVariables)

censusVariables = c(
  "Median Family Income" = "B19113_001",
  "Total Population" = "B25026_001" # in occupied housing units
)

getCensusData = function(geography="state") {
  # gets ACS census data from 2010 to 2020
  
  dataList = list()
  for (i in 1:11) {
    year = 2009 + i
    data = get_acs(geography=geography, # state, county, block, block group 
                   year=year,
                   # geometry = TRUE, THIS DOES NOT WORK
                   variables=c(
                    censusVariables["Median Family Income"],
                    censusVariables["Total Population"])) %>%
      pivot_wider(id_cols="NAME", names_from="variable", values_from="estimate") %>%
      mutate(Year=year)
    
    if (geography == "state") {
      data = data %>%
        mutate(State=state.abb[match(NAME, state.name)])
    } else if (geography == "county") {
      data = data %>%
        mutate(
          County=strsplit(NAME, ', ')[[1]][1],
          State=state.abb[match(strsplit(NAME, ', ')[[1]][2],state.name)]
        )
    }
    
    dataList[[i]] = data # add it to your list
  }
  
  censusData = do.call(rbind, dataList)
  censusData 
}

geography = "county"
censusData = getCensusData(geography=geography)
View(censusData)

write.csv(censusData, paste("../Data/census_acs_", geography, ".csv", sep=""))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
