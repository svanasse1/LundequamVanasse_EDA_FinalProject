## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, census, fig.height=11}

censusDataCounty = read.csv("../Data/census_acs_state.csv")
censusDataState = read.csv("../Data/census_acs_state.csv")

View(censusDataState)

ggplot(censusDataState[censusDataState$Year==2010,], 
       aes(x=Median.Family.Income, y=reorder(NAME, Median.Family.Income))) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x="Median Household Income", y="State")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
